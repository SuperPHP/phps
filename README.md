### PHPS, the PHP to JavaScript transcompiler written in Rust
 - Strong
 - Static
 - Script
 - Speed
 - Super
 - Steroid

#### Why PHPS?

Apparently, PHP is going down :pill: , if it's stuck with web and web only. And I blame the PHP team. PHP had its glories, but the PHP team just dwells on the past.  

Instead of waiting for the incompetent PHP team, which has lost ambition and vision, the PHP community needs to take actions. `PHPS` is one of the recent endeavors.

PHP could be many other things, not just web or WordPress, which is cancer. 

Now, `PHPS` just focuses on one tiny niche market, i,e., to become a full stack language. You can build a backend server with PHP, and transiple PHP to JavaScript so that you don't need to learn other languages.

The `S` of `PHPS` could mean `Strong`, `Static`, `Script`, `Speed`, `Super` and `Steroid`.

 - `Strong` and `Static` mean that it's mandated to use `Strong typing` and `Static typing`, respectively. The purpose is obvious. We hope mandatory strong typing and static typing will eliminate errors at compile time, instead of run time.
 - `Script` is also obvious in that `PHPS` will compile your code to JavaScript which will run in browsers. We hope `PHPS` will enable PHPers to become full stack developers.
 - `Speed`, `Super` and `Steroid` just mean that we hope `PHPS` will make PHP great again and that we hope `PHPS` will open new doors for PHPers other than web or WordPress.
